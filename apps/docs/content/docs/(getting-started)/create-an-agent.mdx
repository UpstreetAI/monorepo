Upstreet AI Agents are persistent digital entities that can autonomously handle tasks, interact with you and your users over chat or social media, and can be customized according to your configuration.

**New to designing Agents?** Explore how to define effective Agent objectives and strategies in our [Agent Design Concepts](/concepts/defining-agent-objectives).

**Coming in from another platform like Tavern?** You can import your previous work into an Upstreet Agent. Check out our [Migration Guides](/migration-guides/tavern).

## Quickstart: Creating an Agent
Here‚Äôs how to set up your first Agent.

### Step 1: Running the command

1. **Set up your project directory**  
   First, create an empty directory where you‚Äôd like to set up your Agent.
   
2. **Run the Command in your terminal**
   ```bash
   usdk create
   ```
   Run the above command in your terminal within your new directory. This will launch a guided interview, where you‚Äôll define essential properties of your Agent.

   You can see more options by running `usdk create --help`.

### Step 2: Complete the Agent Interview

The `usdk create` command initiates an interactive ‚Äúinterview‚Äù process with the **Interviewer**. Here‚Äôs what to expect:

1. **Interactive Prompts**  
   The SDK will prompt you with questions, helping you define your Agent's personality, environment, and other key settings.

2. **Simulated Chat with Your Agent**  
   You‚Äôll be able to ‚Äúconverse‚Äù with the **Interviewer**, defining the Agent's Homespace (its natural habitat) and personality traits through chat-based interactions.

3. **Completion**  
   Once all required fields are captured, the interview concludes, setting up all the Agent features and initialising the necessary files in your directory.

<Callout>
Want to **skip the interview** and jump right in with coding your agent?
You can use the `-p` flag to pass a single creation prompt, or the `-y` to skip the interview process and create a default agent.
You can also omit the agent directory. In that case, a directory will be created for you.
</Callout>

To import your agent from other platforms, `usdk create` also supports [Tavern character cards](https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2) and more.

See [Importing an Agent](/import-an-agent) for more information.

### File Structure

Assuming you‚Äôve named your project directory ‚Äúmy-agent,‚Äù here‚Äôs the structure you‚Äôll see post-setup:

<Wrapper>
<Files className='max-w-lg w-full'>
  <Folder name='my-agent' defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="wrangler" />
    <Folder name="node_modules" disabled />
    <Folder name="packages" />
    <Folder name="codecs" />
    <Folder name="tests" />
    <File name=".gitignore" />
    <File name="agent.tsx" />
    <File name="jest.config.mjs" />
    <File name="jest.setup.mjs" />
    <File name="package-lock.json" />
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <File name="wrangler.toml" />
    <File name="README.md" />
  </Folder>
</Files>
</Wrapper>

For a breakdown of these files, see our [Agent Structure guide](/concepts/usdk/agent-structure).

<Callout>
Remember to keep your Agent's configuration secure. Avoid committing your secret keys to GitHub, and use [Environment Variables](/customize-your-agent#using-environment-variables) to store secrets.
</Callout>

## Editing your Agent

If you wish to edit your already-created Agent through the Interview process, you may run the following command in the directory of your Agent:

```bash
usdk edit
```

## What's next?

Now that you've set up your base Agent, you can choose to dive deeper into Agent customization and potential capabilities by [writing code in React](/customize-your-agent).

If you wish to skip customization and directly launch your Agent on our Platform, you can check out [Testing your Agent](/test-your-agent) and [Deploying your Agent](/deploy-your-agent).
