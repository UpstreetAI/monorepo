  <Accordion title="ðŸŸ¢ Prerequisites">
    - Upstreet SDK installed. [Get the SDK here](/install)
    - Logged into the SDK. Follow the steps to [log in here](/install#log-into-the-sdk)
    - A configured Upstreet Agent. [Create an Agent](/create-an-agent)
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Once your Agent is created, you can test its responses and behaviors before deployment. The Upstreet SDK makes testing straightforward, allowing you to interact directly with your Agent.

## Running a Test Session

To start testing, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
usdk chat <your-agent-directory>
```
Where `<your-agent-directory>` is the **relative path** to the directory containing all your Agent's code. [How to create an Agent](/create-an-agent#file-structure)

This command launches an interactive chat session (REPL-like) with your Agent, where you can input prompts and review responses in real-time.

To exit the chat, type `.exit` in the chat and press the Enter key. Or, you can use the shortcut CTRL+C (macOS users: CMD+C) twice.

<Callout> Agent inferences do not run locally and may consume Upstreet credits during testing. </Callout>

## Testing Tips
- **Specific Task Testing:** Prompt your Agent to carry out the exact tasks or interactions you want to verify.
- **Custom Test Cases:** To automate testing, write test cases using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), ensuring consistency and reliability for complex Agent behaviors.
