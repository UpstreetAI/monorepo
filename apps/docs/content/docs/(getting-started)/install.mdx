import Wrapper from '../../../components/preview/wrapper';

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import pkgJson from 'usdk/package.json';

To start building with Upstreet AI Agents, first set up the Upstreet Agents SDK (`usdk`). If you're new to Agents, check out *[What are Agents?](/concepts/what-are-agents)* for a quick introduction.

For more on SDK architecture and capabilities, see our [Concepts guide](/concepts/agents-sdk/architecture).

## Prerequisites
- Node.js: Version 22.1.0 or above. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)

## Install from NPM

To install the `usdk` command-line tool, use the following command:

<Tabs items={["npm",]}>
 
```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g usdk
```

</Tabs>

### Verify Installation (optional)

To confirm a successful installation, check your SDK version:

<Wrapper>
<div className="bg-transparent prose-no-margin px-20 w-full">

<div className="bg-fd-background rounded-lg">
```bash title="Terminal"
$ usdk version
```
<CodeBlock className='-mt-8' icon={"bash"} keepBackground allowCopy={false}>
        <Pre>{pkgJson.version}</Pre>
</CodeBlock>
</div>

</div>
</Wrapper>

This command should return the installed version number. For additional version details, you can view all available versions of `usdk` on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdk?activeTab=versions).

<Callout>
**Tip:** While you can use `npx usdk@latest <subcommand>` to run usdk directly, we recommend specifying a fixed version for consistency.
</Callout>

## Log into the SDK

Some SDK features require you to be logged in. To log in:

1. Run the command:

   ```bash
   usdk login
   ```

2. A browser will open. Log into Upstreet with your preferred authentication provider.
