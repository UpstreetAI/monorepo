To start building with Upstreet AI Agents, first set up the Upstreet Agents SDK (`usdk`). If you're new to Agents, check out *[What are Agents?](/concepts/what-are-agents)* for a quick introduction.

For more on SDK architecture and capabilities, see our [Concepts guide](/concepts/agents-sdk/architecture).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="1. A computer with a command-line interface">
   - **macOS**: Use the **Terminal** app, located in Applications > Utilities.  
   - **Linux**: Use the **Terminal** application, usually accessible from the applications menu.
   - **Windows**: Use the **Command Prompt**. 
   <Callout>**Important:** Avoid using PowerShell on **Windows** as it often has issues with NodeJS. If you must use PowerShell, you can try out [this possible solution.](/errors#running-usdk-in-powershell)</Callout>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title={`2. Node.js: ${formatNodeVersion(pkgJson.engines?.node || '>=22.9.0')} (required).`}>
    Node.js is the runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside a web browser.
    
    To install Node.js:
   - Go to the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current).
   - Follow the instructions to install it as a package on your system, or download the installer for your OS and follow the setup steps.
   - Open the Terminal from step (1), and run `node -v` to see your Node version.

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
    <Callout type="warn">Ensure the Node version is {formatNodeVersion(pkgJson.engines?.node || '>=22.9.0').toLocaleLowerCase()}, else `usdk` will **not** work.</Callout>

## Install from NPM

To install the `usdk` command-line tool, use the following command:

<Tabs items={["npm",]}>
 
```bash tab="npm"
npm install -g usdk
```

</Tabs>

### Verify Installation (optional)

To confirm a successful installation, check your SDK version:

<Wrapper>
<div className="bg-transparent prose-no-margin px-20 w-full">

<div className="bg-fd-background rounded-lg">
```bash title="Terminal"
$ usdk version
```
<CodeBlock className='-mt-8' icon={"bash"} keepBackground allowCopy={false}>
        <Pre>{pkgJson.version}</Pre>
</CodeBlock>
</div>

</div>
</Wrapper>

This command should return the installed version number. For additional version details, you can view all available versions of `usdk` on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdk?activeTab=versions).

<Callout>
**Tip:** While you can use `npx usdk@latest <subcommand>` to run usdk directly, we recommend specifying a fixed version for consistency.
</Callout>

## Log into the SDK

Some SDK features require you to be logged in. To log in:

1. Run the command:

   ```bash
   usdk login
   ```

2. A browser will open. Log into Upstreet with your preferred authentication provider.
