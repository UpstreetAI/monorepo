Learn how to extend an Agentâ€™s functionality using [React](https://react.dev) components and intuitive primitives to build dynamic, intelligent agents with Upstreet. This guide will walk you through customizing your Agent step-by-step, with examples and tips to inspire you.

## Overview: How an Agent Works

Agents follow a simple but powerful cycle: they **perceive** inputs, **process** them to generate insights or decisions, and **act** on their environment based on these decisions. This perception-think-act model is broken down into components that work together to define your Agentâ€™s functionality.

Read our [*What Are Agents?*](/concepts/what-are-agents) guide to get familiar with Agent basics.

Explore [Upstreetâ€™s Agent Architecture](/concepts/agents-sdk/architecture) to learn more about how Agents operate behind the scenes.

## Agent Structure at a Glance

If youâ€™re familiar with [React](https://react.dev), the structure of an Agent will look familiar. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

```tsx
const MyAgent = () => (
  <Agent>
    <Prompt>
      This assistant is developed by MultiCortical Example Technologies. For support, refer users to our help pages at https://multicortical.example.com/
    </Prompt>
  </Agent>
);
export default MyAgent;
```

The example above shows the basic setup, where a simple prompt is added to guide the Agentâ€™s interactions. The `react-agents` library, however, allows much more flexibility through four core components.
## Key Components of an Agent

Using the `react-agents` library, Agent customization is broken down into four core components:

| Component      | Purpose                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<Prompt />`   | Sets initial instructions and context for the Agentâ€™s behavior. |
| `<Action />`   | Defines actions the Agent can perform, utilizing LLM tool-calling facilities. |
| `<Perception />` | Allows the Agent to perceive and react to real-world events.    |
| `<Task />`     | Schedules tasks for the Agent, enabling it to manage asynchronous processes.  |

Import these components from the SDK package:

```tsx
import { Prompt, Action, Perception, Task } from 'react-agents';
```

Each component adds specific functionality, enabling you to build intelligent, responsive Agents. Letâ€™s dive into each one in more detail.

An Agent consists of a collection of components implementing these primitives.


## Bringing It All Together

Hereâ€™s a sample setup that combines these components:

```tsx
const MyAgent = () => (
  <Agent>
    <Prompt>I'm here to help you with information about our services and products.</Prompt>
    <Action name="fetchProductInfo">Retrieve the latest product details based on user query.</Action>
    <Perception trigger="userInactive">Remind user of inactivity after 5 minutes.</Perception>
    <Task schedule="every day at 9am">Send daily summary report.</Task>
  </Agent>
);
```

This setup provides a well-rounded Agent equipped to respond, perceive, act, and manage scheduled tasks effectively.

## Custom Logic and Advanced Patterns

With `react-agents`, you can introduce custom logic within components, such as conditional rendering, state management, and data manipulation, using native React hooks and patterns.

To explore advanced customization:
- Read our [Custom Components guide](/concepts/agents-sdk/agent-structure).
- Learn more about how [agents are structured](/concepts/agents-sdk/agent-structure).
- Our [PokÃ©dex example](/examples/informative-agent) demonstrates a basic, real-world example of how to create a custom component.
