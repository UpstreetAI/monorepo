## Deploy to Upstreet

Ready to unleash your Agent into the world? Simply run:

```bash
usdk deploy <your-agent-directory>
```

This command uploads your Agent to the Upstreet platform, making it accessible via a unique URL provided after a successful deployment.

<Callout> Deployment consumes Upstreet credits. For more information, see our [pricing section](/pricing). </Callout>

## Self-hosting

Prefer to run your Agent locally? You can use a Cloudflare tunnel to make it internet-accessible. Note that even with self-hosting, using Upstreetâ€™s AI services may still consume credits.

For more on pricing models for both deployment options, visit our [Pricing](/pricing) page.
