### What is React Agents?

React Agents is a framework for building AI agents with React.

It allows you to build AI agents using the same technology, tools, and libraries as you'd use in a traditional React application.

The main difference is that instead of rendering an interface for the user, you're rendering an prompt for the agent.

e.g. suppose you want to write an app that controls a smart home.

#### React app

```jsx
<form
  onSubmit={(e) => {
    turnOnLights(e.target.lightName.value);
  }}>
  <label>Light Name:</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    value={lightName}
    onChange={(e) => setLightName(e.target.value)}
  />
  <button type="submit">Turn On Light</button>
</form>
```

#### React Agents app

```jsx
<Agent>
  <Action
    name="turnOnLights"
    description="turn on the lights in my room"
    schema={z.object({ lightName: z.string() })}
    examples={[{ lightName: 'bedroom' }]}
    handler={(e) => {
      turnOnLights();
      e.data.agent.monologue(`lights changed: ${e.data.message.args.lightName}`);
    }}
  />
</Agent>
```

(some state management code is omitted for brevity)

In the first example, you're rendering a form that the user can fill out and submit to turn on the lights.

In the second example, you're rendering an agent that can perform an action to turn on the lights.

Note that similar to the first example where we use a form to collect user input text, the agent generates data that conforms to the given `zod` schema. The difference is that the agent operates autonomously.

### How does it work?

React Agents translates JSX code into an agentic loop, generating and executing a series of prompts and structured outputs.

It contains a React renderer, chain of thought runtime, integrations, and premade components that work together to execute the agentic app.
