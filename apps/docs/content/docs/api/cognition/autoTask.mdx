## Import

```tsx
import { AutoTask } from 'react-agents';
```

## AutoTask

The AutoTask component enables your agent to plan and execute tasks by breaking them down into steps.

## Usage

1. Add the component to your agent:
   ```tsx
   import { AutoTask } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <AutoTask
         hint="Optional guidance for the agent's task planning behavior"
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

   **Additional Notes:**
   - The `hint` prop is optional and can be used to guide how the agent plans and executes tasks
   - For example, you could set `hint="Break tasks into very small steps"` or `hint="Focus on security best practices"`
   - If no hint is provided, the agent will plan tasks based on its own judgment
   - The agent can:
     - Create new tasks with goals and steps
     - Track progress through task steps
     - Update task details as work progresses
     - Complete or abandon tasks
   - Tasks are managed in memory and persist only during the agent's session
   - Persistence may be added in the future
