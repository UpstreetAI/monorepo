import { InlineTOC } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/inline-toc';

<InlineTOC defaultOpen items={toc} />
The `Uniform` component lets you generate additional metadata for _each_ action. This is useful for getting continious information out of the agent, e.g. getting the current topic, rating, mood, or other information.

The concept is borrowed from [Uniforms in a shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader).

## Importing the Uniform Component
To use the `Uniform` component, import it as follows:
```javascript
import { Uniform } from 'react-agents';
```
