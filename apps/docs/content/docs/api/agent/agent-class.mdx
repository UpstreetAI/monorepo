The `Agent` class has represents a currently running agent. It corresponds 1:1 to an `<Agent>` tag in your code.

<Callout>
You do not construct the `Agent` class yourself. It is created for you when your `<Agent>` gets rendered by the runtime.
</Callout>

To get a handle to the `Agent` class, use one of the following:

### `useAgent` hook
- Any component nested within and `<Agent>` can call the `useAgent` hook to get a handle to the underlying `Agent` class.
```javascript
```
### `handler` callback
- Each `handler` in your agent (such as `<Action handler={(event) => {/* ... */}}>` or `<Perception handler={(event) => {/* ... */}}>`) has an `agent` key on the `event.data`. You can use this for convenient access to the currently running `agent`. e.g.
```javascript
```
### `useRef` hook
- Every `<Agent>` has an internal `ref` that resolves to the `Agent` instance. You can access it the usual way using React's `useRef`:
```javascript
```

When you have a handle to your agent, you can access its methods.
