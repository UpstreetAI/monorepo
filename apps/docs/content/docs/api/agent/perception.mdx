The `<Perception />` allows the Agent to perceive and react to real-world events.

## Importing the Perception Component
To use the `Perception` component, import it as follows:
```javascript
import { Perception } from 'react-agents';
```

The `<Perception />` component is used to define and register a perception within the agent's context. It allows the agent to handle specific types of perceptions with custom logic.

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the `<Perception />` component:
```javascript
import { Perception } from 'react-agents';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Perception
      type="visual"
      handler={(data) => {
        console.log('Handling visual perception:', data);
      }}
    >
      {/* Optional child components */}
    </Perception>
  );
}
```

## Props
The `<Perception />` component accepts the following props:
- type: string
The type of perception being registered. This is a required prop and is used to identify the perception.
handler: Function
A function that handles the perception logic. This function is executed when the perception is triggered.
- children: ReactNode (optional)
Any child components or elements to be rendered within the Perception component.

## Methods
The `<Perception>` component does not expose any public methods. All interaction should be handled through props or by wrapping the component with additional logic.

## Best Practices
- **Event Handling**: Ensure that your event handling logic is efficient and does not block the main thread. Consider using asynchronous functions or web workers for complex processing.
- **Configuration**: Use the `config` prop to fine-tune the perception logic to suit your specific use case. This can help optimize performance and accuracy.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Response**: If the component does not seem to be responding to events, check that your event handlers are correctly implemented and that the component is properly mounted in the DOM.
- **Performance Issues**: If you experience performance issues, review your event handling logic and consider optimizing or offloading intensive tasks.
