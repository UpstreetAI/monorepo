The `Conversation` component represents an ongoing conversation that an agent is managing. It serves as a container for multiple conversation instances, allowing each conversation to be rendered separately along with its context.

## Import

```javascript
import { Conversation } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

```javascript
<Conversation>
  {/* <ConversationTracker /> */}
  {/* ... additional components can go here ... */}
</Conversation>
```

When using the Conversation component, you can provide any number of child components that will be rendered for each individual conversation managed by the agent. This allows the agent to maintain awareness of each conversation and its context separately.

## Props

import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

export const conversationProps = {
  children: {
    description: 'React nodes (components) that will be rendered within each conversation instance.',
    type: 'ReactNode',
    typeDescription: 'Any valid React elements, such as JSX, strings, or numbers, that can be rendered.',
    typeDescriptionLink: '', // Add a link if applicable
    default: 'undefined', // Optional, so no default value
  },
};

<TypeTable
  type={conversationProps}
/>


## How It Works
The Conversation component utilizes two contexts:

- AgentContext: Provides access to the agent managing the conversation.
- ConversationsContext: Supplies the list of active conversations the agent is participating in.
Each active conversation is rendered as an instance of ConversationInstance, which takes the agent and conversation details as props. The children of `<Conversation>` are rendered within each ConversationInstance, allowing them to interact with and respond to the specific context of each conversation.

- Accessing Conversation State
Within any component rendered inside `<Conversation>`, you can access the current conversation state using the following hooks:

```javascript
// inside of a function comonent nested in a `<Conversation>`
const conversation = useConversation(); // get the current conversation state
const cachedMessages = useCachedMessages(); // get the current conversation chat messages
```

This hook provides access to the specific conversation's state, allowing you to interact with or respond to the context of that conversation as needed.

## Example

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Conversation, useCachedMessages } from 'react-agents';

const MessageLogger = () => {
  const cachedMessages = useCachedMessages();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('current chat messages:', cachedMessages);
  }, [cachedMessages]);

  return null;
}

const ConversationLogger = () => (
  <Conversation>
    <MessageLogger />
  </Conversation>
);

// add it to the agent...
export default function Agent() {
  return (
    <Agent >
      <ConversationLogger />
    </Agent>
  );
}
```
