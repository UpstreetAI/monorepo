The `Agent` component serves as a high-level wrapper component that provides the core infrastructure for AI agent functionality in a React application. It acts as a container that:

- Establishes the communication context for AI interactions
- Manages the state and lifecycle of AI agent operations
- Provides necessary context and configuration to child components
- Enables action handling and event processing for nested agent functionalities

## Import

```tsx
import { Agent } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

The `Agent` class has represents a currently running agent. It corresponds 1:1 to an `<Agent>` tag in your code.

```tsx
import { Agent } from 'react-agents'

const MyAgent = () => {
  return (
    <Agent>
      {/* Child components that need access to agent capabilities */}
      <YourAgentLogic />
    </Agent>
  )
}
```

<Callout>
You do not construct the `Agent` class yourself. It is created for you when your `<Agent>` gets rendered by the runtime.
</Callout>

## Reference

The `Agent` class exposes helpful functions to help build your Agent. When you have a handle to your agent, you can access its methods.

### `useAgent` hook
Any component nested within an `<Agent>` can call the `useAgent` hook to get a handle to the underlying `Agent` class. [See reference](/api/hooks/useAgent)

### `handler` callback: 
Each `handler` in your agent (such as `<Action handler={(event) => {/* ... */}}>` or `<Perception handler={(event) => {/* ... */}}>`) has an `agent` key on the `event.data`. You can use this for convenient access to the currently running `agent`. e.g.

### `useRef` hook
Every `<Agent>` has an internal `ref` that resolves to the `Agent` instance. You can access it the usual way using React's [`useRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef):
```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react'; // [!code ++]
import { Agent } from 'react-agents';

const MyAgent = () => {
  // [!code ++]
  const agentRef = useRef(null); // now you can use agentRef.current to access the Agent tags functions. 

  return (
    // [!code ++]
    <Agent ref={agentRef}>
      {/* Child components that need access to agent capabilities */}
      <YourAgentLogic />
    </Agent>
  )
}

```
