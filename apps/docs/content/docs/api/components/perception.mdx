The `<Perception />` component is used to define and register a perception within the Agent's context. It allows the agent to handle specific types of perceptions with custom logic.

## Import

```tsx
import { Perception } from 'react-agents';
```


## Usage
Here's an example of how to use the `<Perception />` component:
```javascript
import { Perception } from 'react-agents';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Perception
      type="visual"
      handler={(data) => {
        console.log('Handling visual perception:', data);
      }}
    >
      {/* Optional child components */}
    </Perception>
  );
}
```

## Props

import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

export const perceptionProps = {
  type: {
    description: 'The type of perception being registered.',
    type: 'string',
    typeDescription: 'A string that identifies the type of perception being handled.',
    typeDescriptionLink: '', // Add a link to further documentation if needed
    default: 'N/A', // This is a required prop, so no default value
  },
  handler: {
    description: 'A function that handles the perception logic.',
    type: 'Function',
    typeDescription: 'A function that is executed when the perception is triggered.',
    typeDescriptionLink: '',
    default: 'N/A', // This prop is required, so no default value
  },
  children: {
    description: 'Any child components or elements to be rendered within the Perception component.',
    type: 'ReactNode',
    typeDescription: 'A ReactNode can be anything renderable by React, such as JSX elements, strings, numbers, etc.',
    typeDescriptionLink: '',
    default: 'N/A', // This is optional, so default can be omitted or marked as 'undefined'
  },
};

<TypeTable
  type={perceptionProps}
/>


## Methods
The `<Perception>` component does not expose any public methods. All interaction should be handled through props or by wrapping the component with additional logic.

## Best Practices
- **Event Handling**: Ensure that your event handling logic is efficient and does not block the main thread. Consider using asynchronous functions or web workers for complex processing.
- **Configuration**: Use the `config` prop to fine-tune the perception logic to suit your specific use case. This can help optimize performance and accuracy.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Response**: If the component does not seem to be responding to events, check that your event handlers are correctly implemented and that the component is properly mounted in the DOM.
- **Performance Issues**: If you experience performance issues, review your event handling logic and consider optimizing or offloading intensive tasks.
