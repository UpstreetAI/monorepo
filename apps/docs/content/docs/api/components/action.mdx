The `Action` component represents an action that a React AI agent can perform. It registers a new action with an agent registry, allowing the agent to trigger the action in response to certain events.

This component is useful for defining discrete, reusable actions with associated schemas and event handlers, making it easier to define and handle actions within an AI-driven context.

## Import

```tsx
import { Action } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

### Example 1

Here is an example of how the Action component might be used:

```tsx
import { Action } from 'react-agents';
import { z } from 'zod';
 
const sendMessageSchema = z.object({
  message: z.string(),
  recipientId: z.string(),
});
 
const handleSendMessage = async (e) => {
  console.log("Sending message:", e);
  // Code to send a message goes here
};
 
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Action
      name="SendMessage"
      description="Sends a message to a specific recipient."
      state="ready"
      schema={sendMessageSchema}
      examples={[
        { message: "Hello!", recipientId: "12345" },
        { message: "How are you?", recipientId: "67890" },
      ]}
      handler={handleSendMessage}
    />
  );
}
```

Here's a breakdown of the example:
- The `name` prop is set to "SendMessage" to identify the action.
- The `description` provides a brief summary of the action's purpose. 
- The `state` is set to "ready" to indicate the current status of the action.
- The `schema` defines the expected input parameters, validating that `message` and `recipientId` are strings.
- The `examples` show sample data for the `message` and `recipientId` inputs.
- The `handler` is an asynchronous function that handles the SendMessage action when it is triggered.
- **Component Lifecycle**: When the Action component is mounted, it registers the action with the agent registry using the registerAction method, associating the action with a unique symbol. When unmounted, it unregisters the action, ensuring no memory leaks.


## Props

<AutoTypeTable path="node_modules/usdk/packages/upstreet-agent/packages/react-agents/types/agents.d.ts" name="ActionProps" />

## Dependencies

The component recalculates and registers the action if any of the following dependencies change:

- `name`
- `description`
- Serialized schema (printZodSchema)
- Serialized examples
- Serialized handler function
