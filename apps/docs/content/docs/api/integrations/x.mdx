## Responding to Mentions

Twitter integration allows your agent to interact with Twitter by responding to mentions.

1. Create a Twitter Developer Account:
   - Go to https://developer.twitter.com/
   - Sign up for a developer account if you haven't already
   - Create a new project and app
   - Make sure your "User authentication settings" are set to "Native app" (Public client)
   - Copy your OAuth 2.0 application credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)

2. Log in with oauth at https://twitter-auth.upstreet.ai/
   - Use the Client ID and Client Secret from step 1

3. Configure your agent:
   - Add the following component to your agent:
   ```json
   import { Twitter } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <Twitter
         token="YOUR_TWITTER_TOKEN" // OAuth 2.0 token
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

   **Additional Notes:**
   - The bot will automatically listen for and respond to mentions of your Twitter account
   - The token should be kept secure and not committed to version control
     - You can use `.env.txt` and the useEnv() hook to load it at runtime
   - The bot polls for new mentions every 10 seconds
   - Twitter API rate limits apply - see Twitter's [developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for details
   - The bot requires a stable internet connection to maintain communication with Twitter
   - Note: if you haven't created the agent yet, please follow this [Create an Agent](/create-an-agent) first.

### Twitter Spaces

The Twitter Spaces integration allows your agent to create and join Twitter Spaces audio rooms.

1. Get your Twitter auth token:
   - Log into Twitter in your browser
   - Open the browser developer tools (F12)
   - Go to the Application/Storage tab
   - Find the `auth_token` cookie under Cookies > twitter.com
   - Copy the value of the `auth_token` cookie

2. Configure your agent:
   ```json
   import { TwitterSpaces } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <TwitterSpaces
         token="YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" // Twitter auth_token cookie value
         url="OPTIONAL_SPACE_URL" // URL of an existing Space to join (optional)
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

   **Additional Notes:**
   - If no `url` is provided, the bot will create a new Twitter Space
   - If a `url` is provided, the bot will attempt to join that existing Space
   - The bot will automatically:
     - Create/join the Space
     - Request speaking permissions if joining
     - Unmute itself when ready
   - The token should be kept secure and not committed to version control
     - You can use `.env.txt` and the useEnv() hook to load it at runtime
   - The bot requires a stable internet connection to maintain the Space connection
   - Twitter's standard rate limits and Space restrictions apply
   - Note: if you haven't created the agent yet, please follow this [Create an Agent](/create-an-agent) first.
