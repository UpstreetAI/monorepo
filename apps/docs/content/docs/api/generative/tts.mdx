## Import

```tsx
import { TTS } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

The TTS component adds text-to-speech capabilities to your agent, allowing it to speak messages using a specified voice endpoint.

1. Add the component to your agent:
   ```tsx
   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <TTS voiceEndpoint="elevenlabs:scillia:kNBPK9DILaezWWUSHpF9" />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

2. Use the `say` action in your agent's responses:
   ```tsx
   agent.say({ text: "Hello, I can speak!" });
   ```
   Or, simply chat with the agent to get them to speak.

### Props
