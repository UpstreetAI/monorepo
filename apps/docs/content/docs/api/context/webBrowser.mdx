The WebBrowser component enables your agent to browse and interact with web pages.

## Import

```tsx
import { WebBrowser } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

1. Add the component to your agent:
   ```json
   import { WebBrowser } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <WebBrowser
         hint="Optional guidance for the agent's browsing behavior"
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

   **Additional Notes:**
   - The `hint` prop is optional and can be used to guide the agent's browsing behavior
   - For example, you could set `hint="Focus on news articles"` or `hint="Only browse product pages"`
   - If no hint is provided, the agent will browse based on its own judgment
   - The bot can:
     - Navigate to URLs
     - Click elements
     - Fill forms
     - Extract text content
     - Take screenshots
     - And more
   - Web browsing requires a stable internet connection
   - Standard rate limiting and robot policies of websites apply
   - Note: if you haven't created the agent yet, please follow this [Create an Agent](/create-an-agent) first.

### Available Actions

The WebBrowser internally uses several actions for interacting with web pages:

- `goto`: Navigate to a URL
- `click`: Click an element on the page
- `type`: Enter text into a form field  
- `extract`: Get text content from the page
- `screenshot`: Capture an image of the page
- `evaluate`: Run custom JavaScript code
- `waitForSelector`: Wait for an element to appear
- `waitForNavigation`: Wait for page navigation to complete

Each action follows standard web automation patterns and includes error handling for common scenarios like:
- Page load failures
- Missing elements
- Navigation timeouts
- Network errors

The agent will automatically retry failed actions when appropriate and can adapt its browsing strategy based on the results.
