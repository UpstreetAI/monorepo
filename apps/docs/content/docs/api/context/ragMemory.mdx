The RAGMemory component enables your agent to maintain long-term memory through a question-answer database system.
This allows the agent to remember and recall information from previous conversations and interactions.
The memory is shared across conversations.

## Import

```tsx
import { RAGMemory } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

1. Add the component to your agent:
   ```tsx
   import { RAGMemory } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <RAGMemory
         chunkMessages={5} // Optional: Number of messages to chunk together when creating memories
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

   **Additional Notes:**
   - The `chunkMessages` prop is optional and controls how many messages are grouped together when creating new memories
   - If not specified, a default chunk size will be used
   - The agent will:
     - Automatically create memories from conversation chunks
     - Summarize chunks of messages into memorable information
     - Store memories for later recall
     - Load relevant memories during conversations
     - Use memories to maintain context across sessions
   - Memories persist across conversations and agent restarts
   - Memories are stored in a vector database for efficient semantic search
   - The agent can access memories that are semantically relevant to the current conversation
