The RAGMemory component enables your agent to maintain long-term memory through a question-answer database system.
This allows the agent to remember and recall information from previous conversations and interactions.
The memory is shared across conversations.

## Import

```tsx
import { RAGMemory } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

1. Add the component to your agent:
   ```json
   import { RAGMemory } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <RAGMemory />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```
