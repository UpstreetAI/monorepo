## Import

```tsx
import { VideoPerception } from 'react-agents';
```

## Usage

The VideoPerception component enables your agent to perceive and analyze images and videos in the conversation.

1. Add the component to your agent:
   ```json
   import { VideoPerception } from 'react-agents';

   return (
     <Agent>
       {/* ... */}
       <VideoPerception
         hint="Optional guidance for the agent's video perception behavior"
       />
       {/* ... */}
     </Agent>
   );
   ```

The passed-in `hint` will be used during inference to determine what aspects of the video the agent should focus on.

The supported media types are:
  - `image/jpeg`
  - `image/png`
  - `image/webp`
