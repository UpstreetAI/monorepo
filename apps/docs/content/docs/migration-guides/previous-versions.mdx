## Updating USDK

Simply run the [installation script](/install#install-from-npm) again, in order to update USDK.

See all versions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdk?activeTab=versions).

<Callout>Note: Updating USDK **will not** update any Agents you created with older versions of USDK. Rather, it may break some functionality with older Agents. We are working on an update mechanism for Agents, stay tuned!</Callout>
