## Updating USDK

Simply run the [installation script](/install#install-from-npm) again, in order to update `usdk`:

```bash
npm i -g usdk@latest
```

See all versions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdk?activeTab=versions).

<Callout>Note: Updating `usdk` **will not** update any Agents you created with older versions of USDK. Rather, it may even break some functionality with older Agents. We are working on an update mechanism for Agents, stay tuned!</Callout>
