## Updating USDK

Simply run the [installation script](/install#install-from-npm) again, in order to update `usdk`:

```bash
npm i -g usdk@latest
```

See all versions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/usdk?activeTab=versions).

<Callout>Note: Updating `usdk` **will not** update any Agents you created with older versions of USDK. Rather, it may even break some functionality with older Agents. To update Agents, check out [this section](#updating-an-old-agent).</Callout>

## Updating an old Agent

You can update an Agent's code from an older version by simply running:

```bash
cd <your-agent-directory>
usdk update
```

This will update the Agent's code from the previous version of `usdk` it was created from, to your **current version of `usdk`**.

For example, if your Agent was created with `usdk` version **0.0.80**, and you want it to update to **{pkgJson.version}**, you should first [update `usdk` itself](#updating-usdk) to that particular version, and then run the above command.
