Tavern is a LLM frontend for power-users. You can create "Character Cards", a way to share AI-generated Characters and personalities.

## Create an Upstreet Agent from a Tavern Character Card

You can import an agent from a Tavern Character Card using the `-i` or `--input` flag with `usdk create`:

```bash
usdk create -i ./character-card.png
```

This will skip the interview process and import the character's:
- Name
- Personality traits
- Description and background
- Profile picture
- Other metadata like scenario and example conversations

The SDK will automatically configure these attributes.
