[LangChain](https://langchain.com/langchain) is a framework for building controllable agentic workflows, by chaining interoperable components.

## Key Features

### Upstreet Agents SDK (USDK):

- React ecosystem integration: Seamlessly integrates with React, allowing developers to use familiar tools and workflows.
- Headless design: Focuses on backend logic for agents, leaving frontend rendering and interactions to the developer.
- CLI support: Provides a command-line interface (usdk) for common tasks, streamlining the development process.
- Modularity: Encourages structuring agents in a way that promotes maintainability and scalability.

### LangChain:
- Chains and pipelines: Allows developers to create complex AI workflows by chaining multiple tools, models, or APIs.
- Tool integrations: Offers built-in integrations with external APIs, databases, and other resources.
- Agent capabilities: Supports agents that dynamically determine which tools to use based on user input or context.
- Memory management: Advanced mechanisms to store and retrieve conversational context for better user interactions.
LLM orchestration: Designed specifically to optimize the use of language models and their APIs, such as OpenAI's GPT.

## Use Cases

### Upstreet Agents SDK (USDK):

- Creating React-based AI agents that integrate seamlessly into existing web applications.
- Building applications where developers want fine control over the frontend UI while leveraging AI for backend logic.
- Projects that need a structured and modular approach to AI agent development.

### LangChain:

- Developing LLM-driven applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, or knowledge retrieval tools.
- Creating workflows that combine multiple AI tools, APIs, and models.
- Applications requiring context retention (e.g., customer support chatbots or personal assistants).
