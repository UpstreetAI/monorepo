## Feature Comparison

| Feature                        | **Upstreet Agents SDK (USDK)**                                                   | **Fetch.ai**                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Programming Language**       | Primarily JavaScript/TypeScript (React-based).                                  | Primarily Python.                                                             |
| **Primary Focus**              | Building headless AI agents for applications in React and modern tech stacks.   | Decentralized AI agent collaboration for a digital economy.                   |
| **Decentralization**           | No, focused on centralized deployment in cloud or local environments.           | Yes, agents operate in a decentralized blockchain-enabled ecosystem.          |
| **Agent Flexibility**          | Focused on customizable business logic for specific app-driven tasks.           | Agents interact across domains, handle IoT, supply chains, and transactions.  |
| **Ease of Use**                | React-based SDK provides familiarity for web developers.                        | Courses and APIs are designed for inclusivity and accessibility.              |
| **Natural Language Interfaces**| Uses React’s UI/UX principles for agent interaction.                            | DeltaV offers search-based natural language interactions.                     |
| **Deployment Options**         | Local or cloud-based deployments.                                               | Cloud-based with support for "Agentverse" (agent marketplace).                |
| **Inter-Agent Communication**  | Limited; focuses on single-agent customization.                                 | Built-in tools for agent collaboration (e.g., Agentverse Explorer).           |
| **Primary Users**              | Web developers and businesses creating headless AI agents for web applications. | Decentralized AI enthusiasts, IoT developers, and blockchain integrators.     |

## When to Use Fetch.ai?
- You need **decentralized agents** capable of collaborating in a blockchain-based ecosystem.
- Your project involves **IoT devices**, supply chain management, or distributed problem-solving.
- You’re leveraging **blockchain technologies** like Ethereum or Cosmos SDK.
