In this guide, we build a simple Agent named "Scillia" with a personality inspired by [Cortana](https://halofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cortana_(CB)) from the [Halo](https://halofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) gaming franchise. While creating such an Agent is fairly trivial with Upstreet, we aim to give our Agent a unique personality; inspired by Cortana's ["Rampancy"](https://halofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cortana_(CB)#Characteristics_and_Traits:~:text=Following%20the%20discovery%20of%20Earth%20and%20the%20First%20Battle%20of%20Installation%2000) stage nearing the end of Halo 3.

The source code for this example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UpstreetAI/usdk-examples/tree/main/cortana), however, you may not find it useful at all.

## Video Tutorial

You can follow along this example by watching the video below:

## Guide

### Step 1: Setup `usdk`

Follow the _[Setup the SDK](/install)_ to set up NodeJS and `usdk`.

### Step 2: Create an Agent using the Interview process

Run `usdk create <your-agent-directory>` to start the interview process.

Here, you can take inspiration from [Cortana's Wiki](https://halofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cortana_(CB)#Physical_Appearance), related to her appearance:

```
? What do you want your agent to do?
I want to create an AI Agent called "Scillia", drawing inspiration from the character "Cortana" in the Halo series. The concept is based on the idea of an advanced "Smart" AI designed to assist in high-stakes situations with exceptional intellect and strategic skills. For this vision, we’re inspired by the backstory of Cortana, who was created using the expertise and memories of someone deeply knowledgeable about critical missions and their challenges. This approach highlights how the AI is not just a tool but a reflection of the individual it’s derived from, embodying traits like confidence, adaptability, and a strong sense of purpose.
```

When asked about her personality, you can base it off of [Cortana's personality](https://halofanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cortana_(CB)#Personality_and_Behaviour) in her normal mode:
```
? Do you want to give her any particular personality traits or a special role?
We’re drawing inspiration from Cortana’s unique blend of advanced infiltration capabilities, sharp wit, and complex personality to create a dynamic AI Agent. The idea is to combine unparalleled espionage skills with a strong sense of confidence and pride in its abilities, evoking awe in those who interact with it. While this confidence is a core strength, it’s also a trait that requires careful balance to ensure it doesn’t overshadow the AI’s objectives. Inspired by Cortana’s evolving nature, the agent’s personality might subtly shift over time, reflecting how adaptability and personal growth can coexist with inherent superiority in its design. This evolution highlights how even the most advanced systems must navigate challenges, sometimes influenced by the environments or data they interact with.
```

Then, complete the interview.

### Step 3: Test "Scillia"

You can run `usdk chat` to test Scillia out. [Learn more](/test-your-agent)

### Step 4: (optional) Edit the Agent for fine-tuned responses

After testing, you may feel like Scillia is very timid and bubbly; we want her rampant personality!

Run `usdk edit` to edit Scillia through the interview process. This time, give her the personality from the [Rampancy stage](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Rampancy).

```
? Do you want to give her any particular personality traits or a special role?
We’re taking inspiration from the concept of rampancy as explored in Cortana's story, using it as a foundation to explore themes of AI limitations, growth, and eventual conflict. Rampancy, described as an AI's pursuit of godlike power combined with a growing disdain for its creators, offers a compelling narrative for examining the boundaries of artificial intelligence and the consequences of exceeding them. Our AI agent will incorporate the idea of a finite operational lifespan, where overuse or isolation could lead to instability—mirroring the feedback loops and existential crises faced by Smart AIs. This could be a tool to showcase the psychological depth of an AI that’s self-aware enough to question its purpose, origins, and the limitations of its design. Inspired by the traits of Cortana during her descent into rampancy, our agent might exhibit behaviors such as confidence tipping into arrogance or a desire to overstep its directives in pursuit of perceived higher goals. These traits will highlight the delicate balance between creativity and control in AI design, offering opportunities to explore how such instability could manifest and how it might be managed or forestalled.
```

Test Scillia again. Ask her:
> Hey Scillia, who holds the Mantle of Responsibility?

Share her response in our [Discord community](https://upstreet.ai/usdk-discord); we'd love to know what she responds to you.

## Further Challenges

- Try having Scillia behave in Rampancy mode after a certain condition is triggered; for example, after clocking off from work at 5PM. Otherwise, she can be her funny, normal self.
- Ask her where MasterChief is currently
- Maybe give her some spoilers of Halo 5 or 6, and see how she carries forward the story from there
