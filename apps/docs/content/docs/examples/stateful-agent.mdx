In this guide, we build a **simple guessing game** which can maintain its own state, and uses NPM libraries to enhance the game's experience.

<Callout>
  We define a **Stateful Agent** as an Agent which can take maintain its own
  memory and event lifecycle.
</Callout>

The source code for this example is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UpstreetAI/usdk-examples/tree/main/guessingGame).

## Guide

### Step 1: Setup `usdk`

Follow _[Setup the SDK](/install)_ to set up NodeJS and `usdk`.

Make sure you are logged in.

### Step 2: Initialize your agent

Create a new agent:

```bash
usdk create <your-agent-directory> -y
```

This will directly scaffold an agent for you in `<your-agent-directory>`. [Learn more](/create-an-agent#file-structure)

Your agent directory now contains the Node application and `git` repository for your agent, should you choose to use `git`.

<Callout>
  The `-y` flag means to skip the [Agent
  Interview](/create-an-agent#step-2-complete-the-agent-interview) process,
  which we don't need here. You can also omit the agent directory. In that case,
  a directory will be created for you.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Start the agentic developer environment

Start a chat with your agent in the terminal:

```bash
cd <your-agent-directory>
usdk chat
```

To edit your agent, open `agent.tsx` in any IDE or text editor.

Hot reloading is supported by default, so when you save your code the agent will automatically reload so you can test out your changes immediately in the chat terminal.

### Step 4: Add the Guessing Game logic

Our guessing game will work like this:

> The Agent will choose a random animal, and then give slight hints to the user until the user guesses the word.

We can use [`unique-names-generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unique-names-generator), an NPM library, to get the random animal name generation logic.

Install this library to your agent:

```bash
cd <your-agent-directory>
npm install unique-names-generator
```

Note: You can also install any library from `npm`.

Edit your `agent.tsx` by adding the following code stub:

```tsx title="agent.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { uniqueNamesGenerator, animals } from 'unique-names-generator' // [!code ++]
const generateRandomName = () => // [!code ++]
  uniqueNamesGenerator({ // [!code ++]
    // [!code ++]
    dictionaries: [animals], // [!code ++]
    separator: ' ' // [!code ++]
  }) // [!code ++]

const GuessingGame = () => {// [!code ++]
// [!code ++]
  // Guessing game logic goes here
  return <></>// [!code ++]
}// [!code ++]

export default function MyAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
      {/*  */}
    </Agent>
  )
}

```

Next, let's write up our guessing game logic! To maintain state, we'll use [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) in React - for the sake of simplicity.

```tsx title="agent.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { Agent, Prompt, Action } from "react-agents"; // [!code ++]
import { useState } from "react"; // [!code ++]
import { uniqueNamesGenerator, animals } from "unique-names-generator";
import { z } from "zod"; // [!code ++]

const generateRandomName = () => uniqueNamesGenerator({
  dictionaries: [animals],
  separator: ' ',
}); // big red donkey

const GuessingGame = () => {
  const [secretWord, setSecretWord] = useState(generateRandomName); // [!code ++]

  return (
    {/* [!code ++] */}
    <>
    {/* [!code ++] */}
      <Prompt>
        {/* [!code ++] */}
        Play a guessing game with the user.
        {/* [!code ++] */}
        The secret word that the user is must guess is {secretWord}.
        {/* [!code ++] */}
        You can give them very subtle hints about the phrase, e.g. "this animal really likes treats".
        {/* [!code ++] */}
        You can also answer general questions if they don't give too much away.
        {/* [!code ++] */}
        However, be cryptic. Don't make the game so easy.
        {/* [!code ++] */}
        When the user guesses the secret word or gives up, call the "guessingGameDone" action with an apppropriate message to reset the secret word.
      {/* [!code ++] */}
      </Prompt>
      <Action // [!code ++]
        name="guessingGameDone" // [!code ++]
        description="The user has guessed the secret word" // [!code ++]
        schema={z.object({ // [!code ++]
          congratulationsMessage: z.string(), // [!code ++]
        })} // [!code ++]
        examples={[ // [!code ++]
          { // [!code ++]
            congratulationsMessage: 'Whoa, you guessed it!', // [!code ++]
          }, // [!code ++]
        ]} // [!code ++]
        handler={async (e) => { // [!code ++]
          const { agent, message } = e.data; // [!code ++]
          const { args } = message; // [!code ++]
          const { congratulationsMessage } = args; // [!code ++]
          agent.say(congratulationsMessage); // [!code ++]
          setSecretWord(generateRandomName); // [!code ++]
        }} // [!code ++]
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Step 4: Import the GuessingGame component in our agent.

```tsx title="agent.tsx"

// ... all the other code

export default function MyAgent() {
  return (
    <Agent>
      {/* [!code ++] */}
      <GuessingGame />
    </Agent>
  )
}
```

### Step 5: (optional) Test the Guessing Game Agent

Run [`usdk chat`](/test-your-agent) to test the Agent in your CLI.

You can start the game by asking:

> I want to play!
