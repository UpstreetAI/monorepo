## Architecture

We've built the Agents SDK on [React](https://react.dev), using the [React Reconciler API](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react-reconciler/README.md). This design choice enables us to not only run the Agents on the server, but also prepares us for a future where Agents are capable of running multi-platform and on edge (maybe in your browser too!).

To learn how the React Reconciler works, we recommend reading the [React documentation on Reconciliation](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state).

## What are Upstreet Agents?

To learn more about basic concepts of Agents, read our general [Agents Concepts Guide](/concepts/what-are-agents).

In Upstreet, Agents are intelligent entities implemented as a React renderer, allowing them to perceive events and perform actions. React components allow for easy composition, customization, and sharing of every part of the stack, while retaining the full flexibility of Typescript to dig down to a lower level.

## Available Commands

These commands are also visible in the Terminal if you run `usdk --help`.
