## The Classic definition
An **Agent** in classical AI refers to any entity capable of 3 fundamental attributes:
1. **Observing** its environment through sensors,
2. **Processing** that information, and
3. **Acting** upon the environment to achieve specific goals.

The concept draws from Alan Turing’s early work on computational machinery, where he envisioned machines capable of following instructions and performing tasks autonomously. His groundbreaking ideas laid the foundation for later development in agent-oriented AI, where agents are tasked with specific objectives and execute actions autonomously to achieve those objectives, mimicking human-like decision-making and problem-solving.

## Agents, today
Over time, **AI agents** evolved from straightforward rule-based systems to more dynamic, complex entities powered by machine learning. Modern agents are sophisticated programs or models that interact with the environment, adapt to user needs, and perform increasingly complex tasks. They encompass varying levels of autonomy, reasoning, and learning capabilities and are commonly used for information retrieval, automation of repetitive tasks, and even decision-making.

**Contemporary AI agents** have extended their functions further. They leverage large language models (LLMs), decision-making frameworks, and even multi-agent systems to break down complex tasks into manageable parts and accomplish them more effectively. These agents are often designed to learn continually, retain context, and respond to nuanced prompts, approaching some characteristics of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**—such as reasoning and adaptability—without fully achieving it.

## The future of Agents and human-like digital beings

The **next generation of agents**, powered by advancements in cognitive architectures and emotion-modelling frameworks, is aiming for even higher levels of adaptability and social-emotional awareness. Here’s where the concept of **digital beings** emerges. These agents are designed not only to complete tasks but to embody **personalities, emotions, and memories** that allow them to interact with people and their environments in a lifelike way. These agents may possess “personalities” grounded in psychological models like the Five-Factor Model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), enabling them to exhibit behavior that resonates with human emotional and social cues. As they develop through interactions, they gain experience, adapt to new contexts, and exhibit responses based on accumulated knowledge and "personal" characteristics, which would mark a significant step toward AGI.

Ultimately, these agents could embody **digital beings** with a kind of “self” that influences their interactions, decision-making, and potentially even self-replication—a progression that mirrors the evolutionary dynamics seen in biological life, akin to the ideas of **Computational Life**. With these advancements, agents could transcend single-use utility, acting instead as intelligent, evolving, and emotionally aware counterparts capable of complex reasoning and forming human-like connections.
